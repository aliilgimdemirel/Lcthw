## What we learn;

* fgets()  
reads  in  at  most  one  less than size characters from stream and stores them into the buffer pointed to by s.  Reading stops after an EOF or a newline.  If a newline is read, it is
stored into the buffer.  A terminating null byte ('\0') is stored after the last character in the buffer.
