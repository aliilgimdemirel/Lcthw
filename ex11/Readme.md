#Arrays and Strings

## What we learn;

* We can see now that;
* 1- The size of arrays is the # inside []'s *int numbers[4]*
* 2- Declaration of an int array automatically does some magic it puts the values starting from index 0. 
* 3- Char arrays put null bytes to its empty indexes. It is similar to the ineffective element of an operation; for integers 0, for characters \0.
  
* Strings are nothing but Character Arrays *char[]*'s that end with a \0 null byte.
