# The Stack, Scope and Globals

## Handy man_make.sh
This particular exercise required manuel compiling of the binaries. So I have put a little shell script for that which;
> for 0 does `make clean`
> and 
> for x >= 0 does `make`

## What we learn;

* "The real purpose of this exercise, though, is to learn where the hell things live in C."
